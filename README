Simple PHP script that interacts with twitters OAuth API and parses their recent tweets for statistics.

Uses Twitter OAuth PHP library by Abraham Williams https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth


Details:
This PHP script will establish an OAuth connection for the user, grab their latest 200 tweets (current limit of the statuses/user_timeline API), and parse through them to build a list of what words the user used and how often. It was created mostly out of boredom.
